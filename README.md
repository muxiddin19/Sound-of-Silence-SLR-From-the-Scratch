 Abstract
 In this paper, we revolutionize the landscape of sign
 language recognition (SLR) with direction vector-based cutting
edge keypoint data vectorization techniques and a powerful mul
timodal deep learning (DL) approach. R-tree indexing employed
 our innovative vectorization method, simplifying and stream
lining SLR data, dramatically boosting data comprehension,
 storage, and computation efficiency. By leveraging a multistream
 architecture that captures multiple dimensions of sign language,
 we not only push the boundaries of interpretability but also
 deliver enhanced recognition accuracy. We address challenges
 like outliers in keypoint data and complex gestures through
 careful data preprocessing and specialized training strategies,
 improving robustness to edge cases such as occluded hand shapes
 and fast motions. By reducing the dimensionality of keypoint
 data, we can minimize the computational cost while maintaining
 high accuracy, which is crucial for real-time applications where
 latency and computational overhead are critical factors. This
 breakthrough sets a new benchmark for SLR systems, opening
 doors to real-time applications and expanding into previously
 untapped modalities. With the promise of further advancements,
 our work paves the way for the practical and widespread
 adoption of explainable and high-performance SLR technologies.
